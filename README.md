An Introduction to ZPL, ZPL is a print language used by many label printers. A print language is a set of commands that can be used to draw elements like text, shapes, barcodes and images, combine these elements, and finally print them.

Imagine that you want to print a label containing a product name, a barcode for a SKU number, and a box around it all. You probably need to tell your printer:

1.  What the product name is, where to print it, and what font to use.
2.  What kind of barcode you want to use, where you want to place it, and the SKU number to encode.
3.  The box location, the box size, and the thickness of the box lines.

Below is an example of a ZPL label template that does just this. We'll break it down and review the details in the next sections.
